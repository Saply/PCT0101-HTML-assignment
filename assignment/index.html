                Big Floppa or simply <strong>Floppa</strong> refers to a series of <em>ironic memes</em> based on photographs of a caracal named Gregory, 
                and sometimes photographs of other medium-sized cats. Originally circulated among ironic Instagram meme accounts 
                starting in late December 2019, the meme gained more widespread popularity online starting in May 2020.
