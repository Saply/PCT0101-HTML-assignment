/* It’s best to include both of these properties for <img> elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the 
   values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to 
   load than the rest of the page contents, the image won’t take up any space on the page at first, but will 
   suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a height
   and width prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and will just appear as a blank 
   space until the image loads.*/
